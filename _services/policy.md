This disclosure policy ("Policy") describes how GTCVE ("we", "us" or "our") discloses third-party product vulnerabilities found by or reported to our research eam.

## Scope
Fluid Attacks will apply this Policy to disclose third-party product vulnerabilities to whom we will issue CVE IDs and that are not in the scope of another CNA (CVE Numbering Authority).

The vulnerability types that we would process are the ones defined in our findings classification. However, vulnerabilities that donâ€™t fit on this classification will be also reviewed if there is an evidenced risk.
