This disclosure policy ("Policy") describes how GTCVE ("we", "us" or "our") discloses third-party product vulnerabilities found by or reported to our research team.

## Scope
GTCVE will apply this Policy to disclose third-party product vulnerabilities to whom we will issue CVE IDs and that are not in the scope of another CNA (CVE Numbering Authority).

## Disclosure timeline
GTCVE follows the steps below to disclose received/found vulnerabilities:

1. When a vulnerability is found, you are expected to create an initial report with all the details of the vulnerability and a proof of concept (if any).

2. Within the next 48 hours, you will receive a response from our team acknowledging receipt of your report.

3. Once the vulnerability is triaged, we send the report to the affected vendor through a secure communication channel (e.g., email).

4. We will wait up to 14 days for the vendor to acknowledge the report. If there is no response in that time, we will proceed with our Responsible Disclosure guideline.

5. If the vendor acknowledges the report, we will follow our Responsible Disclosure guideline to coordinate with the vendor for bug fixing, which is typically done in 90 days.


## Responsible disclosure
Our disclosure process follows the following guidelines:

- An initial advisory will be created upon receiving and triaging the report. The report will contain
  - the affected software vendor/version information,
  - vulnerability type (sensitive information like detailed exploits will be redacted)

- If necessary, we will reserve/issue a CVE for it.

- According to the vendor's response, we have the following 
  - If the vendor does not respond within 14 days, we will publish the advisory (with details of vulnerability) to relevant public email list, or social media.
  - If the vendor acknowledges the issue, we will put the advisory (and the corresponding CVE) on hold for 90 days to ensure the vulnerability is patched before disclosure.
